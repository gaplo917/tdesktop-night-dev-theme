# NightDev Theme Introduction

Telegram Desktop provides a well-tuned night mode color, but I faced some problems when switching from light mode to night mode:

* No default background image when using night mode

* No image in default gallery looks good in night mode

* Contact list is too bright

* Message box background color is too dim

NightDev theme is a one click solution. 'Apply Themes' and done!
